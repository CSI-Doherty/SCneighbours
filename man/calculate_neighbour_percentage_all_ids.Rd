\usage{
calculate_neighbour_percentage_all_ids(obj, meta_data_column, graph = "RNA_nn")
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A Seurat, SingleCellExperiment or SCNeighbours object containing single-cell data.
If in Seurat or SingleCellExperiment form will firist be converted to SCneighbours format}

\item{meta_data_column}{Name of the column in seu@meta.data to pull values from
for grouping and analysis.}

\item{graph}{Name of the nearest-neighbour graph to use from seu@graphs
(e.g., "RNA_nn", "RNA_snn", or "SCT_nn").}
}
\value{
A data frame where the first column 'ids' contains all unique cell type
  labels, and subsequent columns (named by cell type) contain the percentage
  of neighbours belonging to each cell type.
}
\description{
Calculates the percentage composition of neighbours for all cell
  types/groups in the dataset. This creates a matrix showing what percentage
  of each cell type's neighbourhood is composed of each other cell type,
  useful for understanding global neighbourhood composition patterns.
