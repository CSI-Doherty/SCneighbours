\usage{
visualize_neighbourhood(
  seu,
  meta_data_column,
  meta_data_highlight,
  reduction,
  density = F,
  graph = "RNA_nn",
  percent = 95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seu}{A Seurat object containing single-cell data with nearest-neighbour
graphs and dimensionality reductions.}

\item{meta_data_column}{Name of the column in seu@meta.data to pull values from
for identifying the cells of interest.}

\item{meta_data_highlight}{The specific value within meta_data_column to
analyze neighbours for (e.g., a specific cluster or cell type).}

\item{reduction}{Name of the dimensionality reduction to plot
(e.g., "umap", "tsne", "pca").}

\item{density}{Logical indicating whether to plot density contours (TRUE) or
simple point highlights (FALSE). Default is FALSE.}

\item{graph}{Name of the nearest-neighbour graph to use from seu@graphs
(default: "RNA_nn"). Use "RNA_snn" for shared nearest neighbours or
"SCT_nn" if using SCTransform.}

\item{percent}{Percentile level for density contours when density=TRUE
(default: 95). Only used when density=TRUE.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing the dimensionality reduction with neighbours
  highlighted either as red points (density=FALSE) or as density contours
  (density=TRUE).
}
\description{
Visualizes the neighbours of cells belonging to a specific group
  on a dimensionality reduction plot (e.g., UMAP, t-SNE, PCA). Can display
  neighbours either as simple highlighted points or as density contours showing
  the spatial distribution patterns. This helps understand how cell types
  interact spatially and identify neighbourhood structures.
