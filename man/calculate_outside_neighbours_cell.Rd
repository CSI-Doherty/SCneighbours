\usage{
calculate_outside_neighbours_cell(
  seu,
  meta_data_column,
  graph,
  colname,
  reduction = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seu}{A Seurat object containing single-cell data with nearest-neighbour
graphs stored in the graphs slot.}

\item{meta_data_column}{Name of the column in seu@meta.data to pull values from
for grouping and analysis.}

\item{graph}{Name of the nearest-neighbour graph to use from seu@graphs
(e.g., "RNA_nn", "RNA_snn", or "SCT_nn").}

\item{colname}{Name of the new metadata column to store the calculated
percentage of outside neighbours for each cell.}
}
\value{
The Seurat object with a new column in seu@meta.data containing the
  percentage of neighbours (0-100) that belong to a different group than the
  cell itself.
}
\description{
For each cell, calculates what percentage of its neighbours belong
  to a different cell type/group than itself. This metric quantifies cellular
  heterogeneity in the local neighbourhood and can identify boundary cells or
  cells in mixed microenvironments. The result is stored as a new column in
  the Seurat object's metadata.
