\usage{
visualise_neighbour_percentage(seu, meta_data_column, graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{seu}{A Seurat object containing single-cell data with nearest-neighbour
graphs stored in the graphs slot.}

\item{meta_data_column}{Name of the column in seu@meta.data to pull values from
for grouping and analysis.}

\item{graph}{Name of the nearest-neighbour graph to use from seu@graphs
(e.g., "RNA_nn", "RNA_snn", or "SCT_nn").}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing a heatmap of shared neighbour percentages
  between cell types, with hierarchical clustering on both axes.
}
\description{
Creates a clustered heatmap showing the percentage of shared
  neighbours between different cell types or groups. The heatmap is ordered
  by hierarchical clustering to group similar neighbourhood patterns together.
  This visualization helps identify which cell types have similar spatial
  distributions or microenvironments.
