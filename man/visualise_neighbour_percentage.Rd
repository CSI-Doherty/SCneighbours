\usage{
visualise_neighbour_percentage(obj, meta_data_column, graph = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A Seurat, SingleCellExperiment or SCNeighbours object containing single-cell data.
If in Seurat or SingleCellExperiment form will first be converted to SCneighbours format}

\item{meta_data_column}{Name of the metadata column in the object to pull values from
for identifying the cells of interest.}

\item{graph}{either a nearest neigbour graph in igraph, dgCMatrix or Seurat format, or the name of a graph stored in the Seurat object.
(e.g., "RNA_nn", "RNA_snn", or "SCT_nn").}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing a heatmap of shared neighbour percentages
  between cell types, with hierarchical clustering on both axes.
}
\description{
Creates a clustered heatmap showing the percentage of shared
  neighbours between different cell types or groups. The heatmap is ordered
  by hierarchical clustering to group similar neighbourhood patterns together.
  This visualization helps identify which cell types have similar spatial
  distributions or microenvironments.
